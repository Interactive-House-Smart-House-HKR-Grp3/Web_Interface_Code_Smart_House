## Iteration 1
### Meetings
1. ~~Group 3 meetings~~
2. ~~Subgroup web meetings~~
### Tasks
1. ~~Research the project and course requirements ~~
2. ~~Split the development in three parts that can be assign to each of the development team members~~
3. ~~Create Use Case and UML diagrams to help undesrtand the requirements and the different approaches that are possible~~
4. ~~Create a first draft of artifacts~~
5. ~~Update the artifacts according to the feedback received during the first meeting~~
## Iteration 2
### Meetings
1. ~~Group 3 meeting. September 28th. Artifacts updates, new requirements~~
2. ~~Group 3 meeting. September 30th. Communication protocol, design, diagrams~~
3. ~~Subgroup meeting. October 2nd. Data structures and representation. Physical house study. WEb-services discussion. Server-services discussion. Server-services requirements.~~
4. ~~Group 3 meeting. October 6th. Interface Server-Services proposal. Artifacts.~~
5. ~~Subgroup meeting. October 7th. Artifacts. Diagrams. Design. Communication protocol~~
### Tasks
1. ~~Study the physical house documentation (provided by the physical house subgroup).~~ 
2. ~~Create an Interface proposal that reflects the data structures and the services used by the web U.I.~~
3. ~~Create diagrams to reflect the development stage of the project~~ 
4. ~~Update the readme.file with the development of the project. Create a structure that can be used to document the further stages~~
5. ~~Update the artifacts and upload them before the deadline~~
6. ~~Research~~

## Communication Protocol
The communication protocol will facilitate the exchange of data between the web-client and the database-server. In this development stage, the available data related to the physical house were analyzed in order to extract the data necessary to outline a first image of the useful data to be obtained from the database, in order to be represented in the web GUI.
After this analysis, a first Interface proposal was outlined, which includes the method statements. These statements show the data that was considered as input, and the data that is expected as response, from the server.
These dates were forwarded to the two managers to outline the expectations of our subgroup and to help develop a communication protocol used by the entire group.

# Results
## First Iteration
The artifacts received positive feedback, which was considered in their subsequent update. As a major aspect, following the feedback, the risk was restructured.
